# Simulating the motion of three point vortices in a plane

In analogy to the point mass or point charge, point vortices can be defined as zero-dimensional objects characterized by a circulation. These point vortices represent interesting objects of study both purely mathematically (e.g., Aref, 2007 and M端ller, 2018) and meteorologically (e.g., M端ller et al., 2015 and M端ller, 2018). Their time evolution can be described with the Helmholtz equations, which are directly based on Euler's equations of motion, and find application in the scope of Kelvin's circulation theorem. Point vortices can be used to describe atmospheric blocking situations (with three vortices) or to estimate the stability of the polar vortex (with nine vortices), for details see M端ller et al., 2015. <br>
This repository provides functions to calculate the Helmholtz equations for three point vortices in a plane, to integrate them forward in time and to vizualise them.
